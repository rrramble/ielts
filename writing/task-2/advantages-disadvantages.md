## Advantages and Disadvantages with an opinion

There are several subtypes:

- TODO...

### Advantages and Disadvantages with an opinion: does it have more positives than negatives?

It can be formulated as `Does the advantages outweigh the disadvantages?` or `Does this situation have more advantages or disadvantages?`

'More' or 'outweighs' does not mean you need to arithmetically count advantages over disadvantages, but which one is more meaningful, has more strength.
