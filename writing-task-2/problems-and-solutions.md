# Problems and Solutions


## Main tips:
- Look at the plural/singular form:
if it is a `problem` then write 1 problem, if `problems` then write 2 problems.
The same for the `solution/solutions`.
The same for `How can this issue be solved` â€” for this write only 1 solution.
- Look at if it asks for `cause` instead of `problem`.
