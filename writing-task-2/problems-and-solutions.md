# Problems and Solutions


## Main tips:
- Look at the plural/singular form:
if it is a `problem` then write 1 problem, if `problems` then write 2 problems.
The same for the `solution/solutions`.
The same for `How can this issue be solved` — for this write only 1 solution.
- Look at if it asks for `cause` instead of `problem`.


## A structure for One Problem and One Solution

1. Introduction
  - Paraphrase the question
  - Briefly state what problem and solution are (or cause and solution) — `The primary cause of this phenomenon is the ... and the most viable solution is to ...`
2. Main body paragraph #1 (about a problem)
  - State a problem
  - Explain `That is to say that ...`
  - Results `This results in a huge ...`
  - Example `For example, ...`
3. Main body paragraph #2 (about a solution)
  - State solution `A long term solution for this predicament is to ...`
  - Explain
  - Example `For example, ...`
4. Conclusion:
  - Summarize main points `In conclusion, THE_PROBLEM because THE_CAUSE and THE_SOLUTION is the only answer.`


## A structure for One Plural and One Singular

1. Introduction
  - Paraphrase the question
  - Briefly state what problems and solution are (or cause and solution)
2. Main body paragraph #1 (about Problem**s**)
  - State the 1st problem
  - Explain
  - State the 2nd problem
  - Explain
  - Example of the 2nd problem
3. Main body paragraph #2 (about a Solution)
  - State solution
  - Explain
  - Example
4. Conclusion:
  - Summarize main points


## A structure if both are Plural

1. Introduction
  - Paraphrase the question
  - Briefly state what problem**s** and solution**s** are (or causes and solutions)
2. Main body paragraph #1 (about Problem**s**)
  - State the 1st problem
  - Explain
  - State the 2nd problem
  - Explain
  - Example of the 2nd problem
3. Main body paragraph #2 (about Solution**s**)
  - State 1st solution
  - Explain
  - State 2nd solution
  - Explain
  - Example of the 2nd solution
4. Conclusion:
