# Problems and Solutions


## Main tips:
- Look at the plural/singular form:
if it is a `problem` then write 1 problem, if `problems` then write 2 problems.
The same for the `solution/solutions`.
The same for `How can this issue be solved` â€” for this write only 1 solution.
- Look at if it asks for `cause` instead of `problem`.


## A structure for One Problem and One Solution

1. Introduction
  - Paraphrase the question
  - Briefly state what problem and solution are (or cause and solution)
2. Main body paragraph #1 (about a problem)
  - State a problem
  - Explain
  - Results
  - Example
3. Main body paragraph #2 (about a solution)
  - State solution
  - Explain
  - Example
4. Conclusion:
  - Summarize main points
