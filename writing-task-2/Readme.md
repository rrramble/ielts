## Changing words in paraphrasing

Find a synonym that covers **the same meaning** absolutely. It is even better to use the same word again than to use a synonym with an error or than use an improper synonym.

Consider changing the ending or adding a suffix, like '-ing' or '-ed'. This also counts as a use of another word.
