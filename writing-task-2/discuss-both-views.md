# `Discuss both views` type of essays


## Main tips:

- Discuss what others think.
- Both views might not completely contradict each other,
in other words, you may agree (or disagree) with both of them.
However, it is easier to disagree with one view and agree with the other.
- Do not waste your time thinking of your true opinion:
just pick one that you can write easily about.
