# Double Questions
also known as **`Two-part question`**

## Main tips

- If one of the questions is `To what extent do you agree and disagree?` there is no need to fully answer it like in the `Agree vs Disagree` type of task.
Simply answer `fully agree (or disagree)` with **one** main reason without an explanation or example.

## Structure plan

- Introduction: Paraphrase. Clear postition on the 1st question. Clear position on the 2nd question.
- Main body paragraph #1: Main point #1, supporting the 1st position.
- Main body paragraph #2: Main point #2, supporting the 2nd position.
- Conclusion: `In conclusion,` paraphrased summary of the 1st and 2nd main points, all showing your clear positions on the both questions.
