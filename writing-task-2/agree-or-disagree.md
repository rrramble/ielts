# Opinion (Agree or Disagree) essay

## Structure plan

1. Introduction paragraph: Paraphrase the question. `I agree (or disagree) with this statement because` the 1st point and the 2nd point.
1. Supporting paragraph #1: State the 1st point. Explain this point. Show an example supporting this point.
1. Supporting paragraph #2: State the 2nd point. Explain this point. Show an example supporting this point.
1. Conclusion paragraph: `In conclusion,` summarize (paraphrase) the 1st opinion, summarize (paraphrase) the 2nd opinion.


## Main tips:

- For `To what extent ...` simply use `I strongly (or totally or completely) agree` (or `strongly (or totally or completely) disagree`).
- Do not use `some people agree (or think)` because it must be YOUR opinion, not other's opinion.
