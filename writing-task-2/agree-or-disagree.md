# Opinion (Agree or Disagree) essay

## Structure plan

1. Introduction paragraph:
  - Paraphrase the question. `I agree (or disagree) with this statement because`
  - the 1st point
  - `and` the 2nd point.
2. Supporting paragraph #1:
  - State the 1st point.
  - Give 2 explanations for this point.
  - Show an example supporting this point.
3. Supporting paragraph #2:
  - State the 2nd point.
  - Give 2 explanations for this point.
  - Show an example supporting this point.
4. Conclusion paragraph:

  - summarize (paraphrase) the 1st point,

## Main tips:

- For `To what extent ...` simply use `I strongly (or totally or completely) agree` (or `strongly (or totally or completely) disagree`).
- Do not use `some people agree (think)` because it must be YOUR opinion, not other's opinion.
