# Writing Task 1 of the Academic IELTS


## Main tips

- **NO** personal opinion, only data
- Compare only if relevant
- Make a plan: it saves time!


## Structure of a plan
1. Introduction (paraphrase the task)
2. Overview (general trends)
3. Details 1
4. Details 2


### Questions to ask
- Identify what key feature data represents: title, columns, rows, what X- and Y-axis are, is changing over time
- What tenses to use? Consider the past, the present and is there a future projection?


## Describe `Introduction`

Paraphrase the task question.


## Describe `Overview`

Pick 2-4 features and specify general trends.

This means: describe what is at the beginning and what is at the end; do not describe intermediate data.
