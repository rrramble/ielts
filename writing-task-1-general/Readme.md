## Simple rule of choosing a tone:
> This helps achieve the 'Task achievement' criteria.

Use a formal tone unless you write to a **friend**.

Example: For the question `Write a letter to your neighbor asking them to attend your party.` do not assume they are friends with you, rather use a **formal** tone.


## A sign-off

For formal letters:

- `Kind regards,`

Some people do not like this, then use the rule:

- `Yours faithfully,` if you do not know the person (for example, if started with `Dear Sir/Madam`)
- `Yours sincerely,` if you know the person's name

For informal choose one of the following:

- `Best regards,`
- `Keep in touch,`
