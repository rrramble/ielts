# Writing Task 1 of the General IELTS

## Sections of the letter
> This helps achieve the 'Coherence and Cohesion' criteria.

- A greeting.
- Show a reason for writing a letter (`I am writing to invite you to my birthday party.`).
- Main body paragraph covering the 1st bullet point.
- Main body paragraph covering the 2nd bullet point.
- Main body paragraph covering the 3rd bullet point.
- A reverence.


## Simple rule of choosing a tone:
> This helps achieve the 'Task achievement' criteria.

Use a formal tone unless you see the word `friend` in the question.

Example: For the question `Write a letter to your neighbor asking them to attend your party.` do not assume they are friendly to you, but use a **formal** tone.


## Complying with `Coherence and Cohesion` criteria further

- Use linking words appropriately:
  - Do not put them everywhere, trying to achieve the 'Cohesive features' of the criteria.
  - `Furthermore` is used when adding a new point.
  - `However` is used only to contrast or negate.
- Use referencing `it`, `this`, `they` etc., instead of a once-mentioned word.
