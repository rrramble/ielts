# Writing Task 1 of the General IELTS

## Simple rule of choosing a tone:

Use a formal tone unless you see the word `friend` in the question.

Example: For the question `Write a letter to your neighbor asking them to attend your party` do not assume they are friendly to you. Simply use a **formal** tone.
