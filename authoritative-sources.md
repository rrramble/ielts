# Authoritative sources about sections of the IELTS exam

The Internet has many texts, questions, and samples that look real, but non-authoritative persons or organizations have made them.
Respecting their contributions, however, you must know the difference between real and made-up questions.
Do not fail the test because of ignorance.
