## Main tips

### IELTS is a communication test, not a knowledge test
It tests if you can go to the UK, Australia, the USA, or Canada and communicate with people clearly and meaningfully.

Your ideas must be clear, concise, and logical. It does not test your knowledge of fancy words, impressive ideas, or intelligence.

## Criterion of `Using less-common words`

`Less-common` means `topic-specific` or more broadly â€” `widely used but in a topic-specific context`.

For example, for the topic of Photography, truly 'less-common' words are: `focus`, `exposure`, `lighting`, or `scene`. You see, they are not 'high-level'.

Often this criterion is misunderstood as 'use rare words, that are high-level' like [mellifluous](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mellifluous), [cornucopia](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cornucopia), or [plethora](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plethora). In reality, these words are actually 'common words' in the sense that they can be used in every topic.
