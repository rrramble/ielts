## Main tips

### IELTS is a communication test, not a knowledge test
It tests if you can go to the UK, Australia, the USA, or Canada and communicate with people clearly and meaningfully.

Your ideas must be clear, concise, and logical. It does not test your knowledge of fancy words, impressive ideas, or intelligence.


## Complying with `Lexical resource` criteria

Accuracy first: do not use the below hints if you are not 100% sure of them.

Checklist for accuracy:

- Correct spelling
- Correct grammar
- Correct meaning
- Correct collocation
- Do you want to show off using 'a high-level word'? Do not do it!

Other hints related to Lexical resource:

- Appropriate collocations: not ~~`luxurious dinner`~~ but `delicios dinner`; not ~~`delicious hotel`~~ but `luxurious hotel`.
- Range of vocabulary: paraphrase meaning, synonymize words and use a range of topic-specific words.


## Criterion of `Using less-common words`

`Less-common` means `topic-specific` or more broadly â€” `widely used but in a topic-specific context`.

For example, for the topic of Photography, truly 'less-common' words are: `focus`, `exposure`, `lighting`, or `scene`. You see, they are not 'high-level'.

Often this criterion is misunderstood as 'use rare words, that are high-level' like [mellifluous](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/mellifluous), [cornucopia](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/cornucopia), or [plethora](https://www.oxfordlearnersdictionaries.com/definition/english/plethora). In reality, these words are actually 'common words' in the sense that they can be used in every topic.


## Complying with `Coherence and Cohesion` criteria

- Use linking words appropriately:
  - Do not put them everywhere, trying to achieve the 'Cohesive features' of the criteria.
  - `Furthermore` is used when adding a new point.
  - `However` is used only to contrast or negate.
- Use referencing `it`, `this`, `they` etc., instead of a once-mentioned word.
